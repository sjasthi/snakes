A web-based puzzle book generator built with Python and Flask. The application takes a collection of quotes and generates printable puzzle books featuring Snake Word puzzles and Drop Quote puzzles. Users can manage their quote library, customize puzzle preferences, and print or export the generated puzzles.

## ✨ Features

- **Snake Puzzle** — Letters from a quote are placed in a grid in a winding snake path, surrounded by random filler letters. Players find the hidden quote by tracing the snake.
- **Drop Quote Puzzle** — Letters are dropped into columns above a blank answer grid. Players figure out which column each letter belongs to in order to reveal the quote.
- **Load Quotes** — Upload a `.txt` file of quotes and manage them with full CRUD support (Add, Remove, Replace).
- **Difficulty Levels** — Three grid sizes for Snake puzzles: Easy (10×10), Normal (15×15), Hard (20×20).
- **Column Width Preferences** — Adjustable column width for Drop Quote puzzles (10, 15, 20, 25).
- **Show / Hide Solution** — Toggle solution visibility before printing.
- **Print to PDF** — Print any puzzle page directly from the browser with clean page breaks.
- **jQuery DataTable** — Searchable, sortable, paginated quote library on the Load Quotes page.
